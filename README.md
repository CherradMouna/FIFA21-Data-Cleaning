# FIFA 21 Data Cleaning Project

This project focuses on cleaning, processing, and analyzing the FIFA 21 dataset. The main objectives are to standardize, transform, and prepare the data for analysis.

## Data Cleaning Process

The code systematically cleans and processes the FIFA 21 dataset by:

- **Standardizing text data**: Removing unnecessary whitespace.
- **Extracting and transforming contract information**: Parsing contract details to extract start dates, end dates, and calculating contract lengths.
- **Converting height and weight measurements**: Standardizing heights to centimeters and weights to kilograms.
- **Handling special cases**: Managing entries for players on loan or free agents.
- **Cleaning ratings and other relevant columns**: Ensuring consistent and accurate data across all columns.

## Tools Used

- **Python**: Programming language used for data cleaning and analysis.
- **NumPy**: Library for numerical computations in Python.
- **Pandas**: Library for data manipulation and analysis in Python.
- **Google Colab**: Cloud-based platform for running Python code and notebooks.

## Steps Involved

1. **Data Understanding**:
   - Examined the dataset to understand its structure, columns, and their meanings.

2. **Data Exploration**:
   - Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify patterns and anomalies.

3. **Handling Missing Values**:

4. **Standardizing Formatting**:
   - Resolved inconsistent formatting issues, especially in height and weight columns, using transformations and data normalization techniques.

5. **Validation and Quality Checks**:
   - Performed rigorous validation to ensure the quality, accuracy, and integrity of the cleaned data.

## Inspiration

This project was inspired by the tutorial from **Her Data Project**, which can be accessed [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mYbrpfAU6k). It serves as a learning exercise for data analysis techniques.
